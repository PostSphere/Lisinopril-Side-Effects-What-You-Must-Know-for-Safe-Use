## What Is Lisinopril and How Does It Work?

Lisinopril lowers blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels. It blocks the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which normally causes blood vessels to tighten.

**Key Mechanisms:**

* Inhibits ACE enzyme
* Reduces production of angiotensin II
* Promotes vasodilation
* Improves blood flow and reduces strain on the heart

**Common Uses:**

* Hypertension: Controls blood pressure
* Heart Failure: Eases symptoms, improves survival
* Post-Heart Attack Recovery: Helps heart function better
* Kidney Protection: Especially in diabetic patients

Understanding its purpose helps in identifying which side effects may occur.
